The results can be summarized to the following observations:

1. the introduction of a human head changes the radiation patterns drastically
2. the distance between the antenna and the human head also influence the characteristics of the E/M field
3. if we increase the distance or insert a smaller sphere the characteristics are not sharply changed
4. if the distance is reduced then the maximum value of SAR is increased but a smaller part of the tissue is affected
5. there is a computaional tradeoff between visualization results (when we choose a non uniform grid in areas
of greater detail) and computational resources
6. the child human head model is more affected in combination with the adult one
